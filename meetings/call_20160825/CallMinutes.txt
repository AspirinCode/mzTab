Did I miss anyone? Apologies if so.

Discussion items

*Recap meeting Liverpool, adoption from proteomics, draft of specification, example sketches, no formal checks, and validation.
Proteomics mzTab can support ID or quant workflows; metabolomics almost always quantitative, therefore decided no need to model ID and quant separately. Still we have kept distinction between Complete and summary workflows.


mztab for small molecules has 3 sections (SML/F/E). SML is for summary only; Complete file must have all three layers. 
SML is top level inferred quant of molecules (i.e. final results)
SMF is quant of features on LC/GC-MS e.g. diff adduct forms; diff charge states which may be combined to arrive at value in SML level
SME is evidence stream

Downward references between layers.


*Going through the specification document, revision of section 6.6.

- Changes and discussion can be inferred from diff on gitHub and comments in margin.

-specification allows both proteomics and metabolomics to be present in a file, decided to change so that only one can be present in a single file

- should SML_ID be NULLABLE (v.s., refers to Steffens question) 

-referencing entries: mix and match in column but not in cell (--> '|'  is ambiguity indication) 

-phrasing for all subsections => if in case of ambiguity report all the same number of items identified (and referenced), in one cell e.g. in 6.6.4 (see Spec doc for further explanation)

-smiles sometimes not possible, so allowed to be nullable 

-discussion around calc_neutral_mass and exp_m/z or exp_neutral_mass in SML table; further discussion needed.

- highlighted in spec.doc. (e.g. which metadata section if retention time unit changes) 

-adduct_ions might be too complex to list all adduct ions, but need adduct ions involved to get to neutral mass - leave out?

-reliability - metabolomics society has different approaches in store, one strong point for representation like now is the ability to order rows accordingly; no code for "don't want to say" yet

 -URI bar separated 
 
 -best_search_engine ought to be deleted already? needs more discussion..

*action point Steffen: submit reliability cv terms to google group (and PSI CV)

*timeslot - toggle to include different time zones

The next one will be at 4pm UK time on 31st Aug: http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20160831T16&p1=301
