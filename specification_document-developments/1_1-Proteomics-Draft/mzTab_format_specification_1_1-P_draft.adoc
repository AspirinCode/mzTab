== Abstract

The Human Proteome Organisation (HUPO) Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI)
and Metabolomics Standards initiative (MSI) define community standards for data representation
in proteomics/metabolomics to facilitate data comparison, exchange and verification.

In this context, the two organizations are working together on a shared standard for
downstream results, following mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. This document defines a
tab-delimited text file format to report proteomics experiments results. You can see the
document specification for the metabolomics experiments here https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzTab.

== Introduction

[[background]]
=== Background

This document addresses the systematic description of protein/peptide identification and quantification
data retrieved from mass spectrometry (MS)-based experiments. A large number of software tools are available
that analyze MS data and produce a variety of different output data formats.

mzTab-P is intended as a reporting standard for quantitative results from proteomics approaches.
This format is also intended to provide local LIMS systems as well as MS proteomics repositories a
simple way to share and combine basic information.

mzTab has been developed with a view to support the following general tasks (more specific use cases
are provided in <<use-cases-for-mztab>>):

1.  _Facilitate the sharing of final experimental results,_ especially with researchers outside the field of proteomics.
2.  _Export of results to external software,_ including programs such as Microsoft Excel^®^ and Open Office Spreadsheet and statistical software / coding languages such as R.
3.  _Act as an output format of (web-) services_ that report MS-based results and thus can produce standardized result pages.
4.  _Be able to link to the external experimental evidence_ e.g. by referencing back to Peak List files.

This document presents a specification, not a tutorial. As such, the presentation of technical details is deliberately direct. The role of the text is to describe the model and justify design decisions made.
The document does not discuss how the models should be used in practice, consider tool support for data capture or storage, or provide comprehensive examples
of the models in use. It is anticipated that tutorial material will be developed independently of this specification.

[[document-structure]]
=== Document Structure

The remainder of this document is structured as follows. <<use-cases-for-mztab>> lists use cases
mzTab-P is designed to support. <<notational-conventions>> describes the terminology used.
<<relationships-to-other-specifications>> describes how the specification presented
in <<format-specification>> relates to other specifications, both those that it extends
and those that it is intended to complement. <<resolved-design-and-scope-issues>> discusses
the reasoning behind several design decisions taken. <<format-specification>> contains the
documentation of the file. <<non-supported-use-cases>> lists use cases that are currently not supported.
Conclusions are presented in <<conclusions>>.

[[use-cases-for-mztab]]
== Use Cases for mzTab

The following cases of usage have driven the development of the mzTab data model, and are used to define
the scope of the format in version 1.0.

1. mzTab-P files should be simple enough to make proteomics results accessible to people outside the
respective fields. This should facilitate the sharing of data beyond the borders of the fields and
make it accessible to non-experts.

2. mzTab-P files should contain sufficient information to provide an electronic summary of all findings
in a proteomics study to permit its use as a standard documentation format for ‘supplementary material’
sections of publications in proteomics. It should thus be able to replace PDF tables as a way of
reporting protein/peptide make published identification and quantification information more accessible.

3. mzTab-P files should enable reporting at different levels of detail: ranging from a simple summary
of the final results to a detailed reporting including the experimental design.

4. It should be possible to open mzTab-M files with “standard” software such as Microsoft Excel^®^ or
Open Office Spreadsheet. This should furthermore improve the usability of the format to people outside
the fields of metabolomics.

5. mzTab-P files should make MS derived results easily accessible to scripting languages allowing
bioinformaticians to develop software without the overhead of developing sophisticated parsing code.
Since mzTab files will be comparatively small, the data from multiple experiments can be processed at
once without requiring special resource management techniques.

6. It should be possible to contain the complete final results of an MS-based proteomics experiment
in a single file. This should furthermore reduce the complexity of sharing and processing an experiment’s
final results. mzTab-P files should be able to store quantitative values for protein/peptide identifications.

7. It should be useful as an output format by web-services that can then be readily accessed by tools
supporting mzTab-P.

8. It should be possible to directly link a Peptide/Protein record to its source spectrum in an
external MS data file.

[[notational-conventions]]

== Notational Conventions

The key words “MUST,” “MUST NOT,” “REQUIRED,” “SHALL,” “SHALL NOT,” “SHOULD,” “SHOULD NOT,” “RECOMMENDED,”
“MAY,” and “OPTIONAL” are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 <<bradner-1997, (Bradner 1997)>>.

[[relationship-to-other-specifications]]
== Relationship to Other Specifications

The specification described in this document has not been developed in isolation;
indeed, it is designed to be complementary to, and thus used in conjunction with, several
existing and emerging models. Related specifications include the following:

1.  _mzML_ (http://www.psidev.info/mzml). mzML is the PSI standard for capturing mass spectra / peak
lists resulting from mass spectrometry in proteomics <<martens-2011, (Martens _et al._ 2011)>>.
mzTab files ARE RECOMMENDED to used in conjunction with mzML, although it will be possible to use
mzTab with other formats of mass spectra like vendor RAW files, Peaks Lists (e.g mgf).

[[relationship-to-mztab-1.0]]
=== Relationship to mzTab 1.0

The first stable version of mzTab (version 1.0) was developed primarily by the PSI as a format for
the final results (identification or quantification) of a proteomics experiment, using MS.

[[the-psi-mass-spectrometry-controlled-vocabulary-cv]]
=== Recommend Controlled Vocabularies (CVs)

The PSI-MS controlled vocabulary (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/ms): is intended to provide terms for
annotation of mass spectrometry-related file formats. The CV has been generated with a collection of terms
from software vendors and academic groups working in the area of mass spectrometry and MS informatics.
Some terms describe attributes that must be coupled with a numerical value attribute in the CvParam
element (e.g. MS:1001191 “p-value”) and optionally a unit for that value (e.g. MS:1001117, “theoretical mass”, units = “dalton”).
The terms that require a value are denoted by having a “datatype” key-value pair in the
CV itself: MS:1000511 "ms level" value-type:xsd:int. Terms that need to be qualified with units are denoted with a “has_units” key in the CV itself
(relationship: has_units: UO:0000221 ! dalton).

As recommended by the PSI CV guidelines, psi-ms.obo should be dynamically maintained via the psidev-ms-vocab@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list that
allows any user to request new terms in agreement with the community involved. Once a consensus is reached
among the community the new terms are added within a few business days. If there is no obvious consensus,
the CV coordinators committee should vote and make a decision. A new psi-ms.obo should then be released by
updating the file on the GitHub server without changing the name of the file.

We recommended the use of PSI-MS for all the terms that are not related with the sample and experimental design. The following ontologies or controlled vocabularies specified
below may also be suitable or required other parts of the experimental design and post-translational
modification:

* PRIDE Controlled Vocabulary (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/pride): PostTranslation Modifications
* Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/efo): Experiental Factors including tissues, celltypes, etc.
* PSI-MOD and UNIMOD: Post-translational Modifications.

[[resolved-design-and-scope-issues]]
== Resolved Design and scope issues

There were several issues regarding the design of the format that were not clear cut, and a design choice
was made that was not completely agreeable to everyone. So that these issues do not keep coming up,
we document the issues here and why the decision that is implemented was made.

[[use-of-identifiers-for-input-spectra-to-a-search]]
=== Use of identifiers for input spectra to a search

PSMs molecules MUST be linked to an identifier of the source spectrum (in an external file)
from which the identifications are made by way of a reference in the `spectra_ref` attribute and via
the `ms_run` element which stores the URL of the file in the `location` attribute.

It is advantageous if there is a consistent system for identifying spectra in different file formats.
The following table is implemented in the PSI-MS CV for providing consistent identifiers for different
spectrum file formats.

NOTE: This table shows examples from the CV but will be extended. The CV holds the definite specification
for legal encodings of spectrumID values.

[[table-1, CV Terms and Rules]]
.Controlled vocabulary terms and rules implemented in the PSI-MS CV for formulating the “nativeID” to identify spectra in different
file formats.

[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
|*ID* |*Term* |*Data type* |*Comment*
|MS:1000768 |Thermo nativeID format |controllerType=xsd:nonNegativeInteger controllerNumber=xsd:positiveInteger scan=xsd:positiveInteger. |controller=0 is usually the mass spectrometer
|MS:1000769 |Waters nativeID format |function=xsd:positiveInteger process=xsd:nonNegativeInteger scan=xsd:nonNegativeInteger |
|MS:1000770 |WIFF nativeID format |sample=xsd:nonNegativeInteger period=xsd:nonNegativeInteger cycle=xsd:nonNegativeInteger experiment=xsd:nonNegativeInteger |
|MS:1000771 |Bruker/Agilent YEP nativeID format |scan=xsd:nonNegativeInteger |
|MS:1000772 |Bruker BAF nativeID format |scan=xsd:nonNegativeInteger |
|MS:1000773 |Bruker FID nativeID format |file=xsd:IDREF |The nativeID must be the same as the source file ID
|MS:1000774 |multiple peak list nativeID format |index=xsd:nonNegativeInteger |Used for referencing peak list files with multiple spectra, i.e. MGF, PKL, merged DTA files. Index is the spectrum number in the file, starting from 0.
|MS:1000775 |single peak list nativeID format |file=xsd:IDREF |The nativeID must be the same as the source file ID. Used for referencing peak list files with one spectrum per file, typically in a folder of PKL or DTAs, where each sourceFileRef is different
|MS:1000776 |scan number only nativeID format |scan=xsd:nonNegativeInteger |Used for conversion from mzXML, or a DTA folder where native scan numbers can be derived.
|MS:1000777 |spectrum identifier nativeID format |spectrum=xsd:nonNegativeInteger |Used for conversion from mzData. The spectrum id attribute is referenced.
|MS:1001530 |mzML unique identifier |xsd:string |Used for referencing mzML. The value of the spectrum id attribute is referenced directly.
|===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================


In mzTab, the spectra_ref attribute should be constructed following the data type specification in <<table-1>>.
As an example, to reference the third spectrum (index = 2) in an MGF (Mascot Generic Format) file:

----
MTD ms_run[1]-format [MS, MS:1001062, Mascot MGF file, ]

MTD ms_run[1]-id_format [MS, MS:1000774, multiple peak list nativeID format, ]

...

SEH ... spectra_ref ...

SME ... ms_run[1]:index=2 ...
----

Example: Reference the spectrum with identifier “scan=11665” in an mzML file.

----
MTD ms_run[1]-format [MS, MS:1000584, mzML file, ]

MTD ms_run[1]-id_format [MS, MS:1001530, mzML unique identifier, ]

...

SEH ... spectra_ref ...

SME ... ms_run[1]:scan=11665 ...
----

=== Recommendations for reporting replicates within experimental designs

Modeling the correct reporting of technical/biological replicates within experimental designs is supported in mzTab as shown in <<figure-1>>.
The following components have various cross-references and MUST be used in different types of mzTab files
as follows:

* _study_variable_ – The variables about which the final results of a study are reported, which may have been derived following grouping a set of different samples (biological/technical replicates).
The same concept has been defined by others as “experimental factor”.
* _sample_ – a biological material that has been analyzed, to which descriptors of species, cell/tissue type etc. SHOULD be provided.
In all of types of mzTab file, these MAY be reported in the metadata section as sample[1-n]-description.
Samples are NOT MANDATORY in mzTab, since many software packages cannot determine what type of sample was analyzed
(e.g. whether biological or technical replication was performed). However, we RECOMMENDED to specified the sample information
if an statistical analysis has been performed during the quantification experiment.
* _assay_  – The application of a measurement about the sample (in this case through MS) – producing values about peptides and proteins.
One assay is typically mapped to one MS run in the case of label-free MS analysis (with no pre-fractionation) or multiple
assays are mapped to one MS run for multiplexed techniques, along with a description of the label or tag applied.
* _ms_run_ – An MS run is effectively one run on an MS instrument, and is referenced from assay in different contexts.
In the case of pre-fractionation into _n_ fractions, an assay SHOULD reference _n_ ms_runs.

Clear definitions of biological and technical replicates are difficult to provide as these are somewhat dependent upon the biological domain. However, we use the following general definitions in mzTab.

* Biological replicates are where different samples have been analyzed by MS.
* Technical replicates are where same samples are analyzed multiple times by MS.

NOTE: There is deliberately no attempt to define the boundary of the term “sample”.

If sample level information is provided optimally, it is expected that _n_ biological replicates can be mapped to sample[1-n]; _m_ technical replicate measurements of sample 1 SHOULD be mapped to assay[1-m] referencing sample[1] (for example).
However, an open challenge remains since analysis software is often not aware of whether replicates (multiple MS runs) are originally biological or technical in nature. As such, the default behavior for mzTab exporters from quantitative
software is to exclude sample level information and report quantitative data for assay[1-n] and study_variable[1-n].

Additional annotation software would typically be required to add the sample-level information, as provided (often manually) by the
user.

[[figure-1]]
.Simple experimental designs in mzTab can be represented using a combination of study_variable (SV), assay, ms_run and sample. Quantitative values can be reported in files for SVs and assays. A) SV is intended to capture different groups of replicates, which might have resulted from different sample types e.g. control versus treated (as 2 SVs), n time points over a treatment course (as n SVs). Nested designs can be captured by annotation of additional CV terms onto SVs. B) assay captures a measurement made about a molecule (peptide or small molecule) where multiple assays within the same group are taken to be replicates of some kind (biological or technical). Additional details about the sample processing to generate an assay should not be captured in mzTab, but could be captured via a reference to an external suitable format such as ISA-TAB. C) ms_run captures a single run on an MS instrument. If pre-fractionation has been performed then an assay can reference to multiple ms_runs. In this case, ms_run can have a nested structure enabling assay to reference to a group of MS files. D) samples are optional in mzTab since the quantitative software may often be unaware of the biological samples that have been analysed.
